# Hazard_detection
Our solution focuses on building an AI-driven Road Hazard Detection and Real-Time Alert System that enhances road safety using intelligent computer vision and geospatial analytics. The system detects potholes, debris, unmarked speed breakers, and stalled vehicles from dashcam or mobile video feeds in near-real time. It ensures complete privacy by performing on-device blurring of faces and license plates before transmitting data. Through geotagging and clustering, duplicate alerts are eliminated, and instant notifications are sent only to nearby drivers, optimizing both accuracy and bandwidth. This creates a collaborative safety network where every vehicle acts as a sensor, contributing to safer and smarter roads.
